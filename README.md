# AppDev1_Project

A group project from the Apllication Development class at John Abbott College.

Throughout the majority of our first Application Development class, we worked in groups on a budget application. This project was done during the majority of our semester. We had numerous sprints with many different requirements for this project. The app works by either creating or loading an existing database from a file and adding or modifying the data.

Other capabilities of the app include customizing the colors, searching for specific expenses by category, date, or even just something more specific with the search bar at the top. the expenses can also be modified by left-clicking on the grid, or right-clicking, which will bring up a menu.
